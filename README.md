# Challenge-1

## Description

Horiseon is a marketing agency that wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so their website is optimized for search engines.

## Updates

When I first viewed the code I noticed that it didn't have semantic elements, the code was wrapped in the div element (non-semantic). I updated all the divs to semantic elements using the header, footer, section, article, and aside elements.
